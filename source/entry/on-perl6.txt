<p><span class="preamble">Not since <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">GNU Hurd</a>, or maybe <a href="http://www.chandlerproject.org">Chandler</a>, have we seen a project take so long that people give up thinking about it out of sheer exhaustion. Perl 6 is another such project, but it's development seems to be getting closer to a real release, and it almost looks like something I may want to use.</span></p>

<p>Rakudo, a Perl 6 implementation built on top of the Parrot Virtual Machine, as of <a href="http://rakudo.org/node/57">October 22, 2009</a> passes 85% of the spec tests. And recently, work began on the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~JonathanWorthington/journal/39530">Perl 5 interop</a>, which makes it possible to call older Perl code from within the Perl 6 language. A good interop is likely the basis of Perl 6's success, since there exists millions&mdash;maybe even billions, of lines of code in the wild written in Perl 5.</p>

<p>The new Perl has some very interesting new features that are sure to make unreadable Perl even more unreadable, and at the same time save expert Perl mongers lots of extra keystrokes.</p>
