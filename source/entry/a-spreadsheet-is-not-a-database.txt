<p><span class="preamble"><a href="http://justin.abrah.ms/mentoring/databases-as-an-excel-file.html">Thinking of Databases as an Excel File</a> is too simplistic a metaphor and misses the main point that differentiates the two.</span></p>

<p>But, Justin isn't completely wrong. Sure, a spreadsheet can represent rows and columns of data (i.e. tabular). And, some spreadsheet packages actually go so far as to allow you to have multiple "sheets", which, with a bit of stretching and (perhaps) misuse can even be related to another table for use in a custom input (e.g. a drop down list) or who knows what. There's also this concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table">pivot tables</a>&mdash;the equivalent in a relational database being an aggregate query.<sup><a id="return-view" href="#note-view">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Why is his metaphor too simplistic? It relates<sup><a id="return-pun" href="#note-pun">[2]</a></sup> to the fact that a spreadsheet's data is "live." It's a living thing, reacting to changes in input, changes in formulas, newly added formulas, etc.. The difference between a relational database and a spreadsheet is simple. The spreadsheet <em>is</em> a live, running program, and the tables in a relational database are nothing more than rotting bits.</p>

    <li id="note-view">Hopefully you don't notice, but it's possible in some RDBMSes to create what are known as views (or materialized views, or both). With these, you could essentially define a query (or a procedure) that computed the same data as could be found in your spreadsheet, in a sort of "live" fashion. Updates either occur on some timer, or when you request it via a query.<a href="#return-view">&crarr;</a></li>
