<p><span class="preamble">If you know me in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatspace#Related_terminology">meatspace</a>, you probably know that I've been working on a programming language called <a href="http://tinlang.org">Tin</a> in my spare time for quite some time now. The fact that it's taking so long is more a reflection on free time, than the fact that I'm stupid, or lack ideas<sup><a id="return-stupid" href="#note-stupid">[1]</a>
</span></p>

<p>But, why write a new programming language anyway? There are an amazing number of them&mdash;and most of them are just slight variations in syntax from another one. And, Tin, well, Tin is a Scheme derivative (which is a Lisp derivative) at that. There's a crazy ton of Lisps out there, and no one uses Lisp<sup><a id="return-lisp" href="#note-lisp">[2]</a></sup>!

    <li id="note-stupid">I am in fact both stupid and lacking in ideas, but time is really (honestly) the biggest blocker</li>
    <li id="note-lisp">Which is untrue of course. There's lots of companies using Clojure in production, and more every week. In addition, Common Lisp is still relevant, with many actively developed implementations and companies backing it. Lisp is alive and well. And, yes, even Scheme has users.</li>
