<p><span class="preamble">Programmers who partake in side projects have a significant advantage
career-wise over those who don't. There are millions of reasons that
this is true, but one such reason is that of hiring.</span></p>

<p>Given two nearly identical candidates, with the exception of side
projects (e.g. candidate <em>A</em> has none, while candidate <em>B</em> writes
programming languages on the side), candidate <em>B</em> will almost certainly
get an offer before candidate <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>Of course this assertion is due to the perception that if one is
motivated enough to work outside of work, and eager enough to learn
new technologies they'll have no trouble taking on more demanding
tasks, or tasks which require a decent amount of "ramp-up."</p>

<p>However, there is another side of this coin. Programmers who actively
work on side projects might be thinking more about their side projects
than their actual job.</p>

<p>Perhaps to them, "work" is just 40 hours of "<a href="http://blip.tv/clojure/hammock-driven-development-4475586">Hammock Time</a>".</p>
