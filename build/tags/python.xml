But, they are often painful to use; take for example the following task.</span></p>

<p>In Java, I have a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a> and I wish to get a random key. Well, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/AbstractMap.html">AbstractMap</a> doesn't define a way to get a random key, but it does provide a way to get a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">Set</a> of keys. Does Set have a way to get a random element? No, but you can create an Array from a Set with the <code class="inline">toArray()</code> method on Set.</p>

<p>We end up with the following:</p>

<pre><code>public String randomKey() {
    // Assuming: map = HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;;
    Set&lt;String&gt; set = map.keySet();
    Object[] strings = set.toArray();
    Random random = new Random();
    if (strings.length &gt; 0) {
        return (String)strings[random.nextInt(strings.length)];
    }
    return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this isn't necessarily bad, but we have to create a new array, and a new set each time we want a random key. We can of course be smarter about this by caching the array and/or set, but then we run into synchronization issues. We also get screwed when we attempt to implement the <code class="inline">popRandom()</code> operation, which could be implemented like so:</p>

<pre><code>public String popRandom() {
    String key = randomKey();
    if (key != null) {
        String value = map.get(key);
        map.remove(key);
        return value;
    }
    return null; // or more appropriately, throw an exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, we're doing all this extra copying, allocating and deleting, when all we really need is an iterator, to solve this generically in <code class="inline">O(n)</code> time.</p>

<pre><code>public String randomKey() {
    // randomKey method in O(n) using imaginary iterator() on AbstractMap
    int size = map.size();
    if (size &gt; 0) {
        int index = new Random().randInt(size);
        Iterator&lt;String&gt; keys = map.iterator();
        while (keys.hasNext()) {
           if (index-- == 0) {
               return keys.next();
           }
           keys.next();
        }
    }
    return null;
}
</code></pre>


<p>This sort of thing isn't necessarily true for dynamic languages like Python which normally have ways to iterate over keys in a map, dictionary or set. They still don't have a way to get a random element from either out of the box without resulting to the <code class="inline">O(n)</code> iteration method, or converting to a list and using a random index approach.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(set([1, 2, 3]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/random.py", line 248, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
TypeError: 'set' object is unindexable
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice({'1': 'world', '2': 'galaxy', '3': 'universe'})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/random.py", line 248, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
KeyError: 2
</code></pre>

<p>And of course that makes sense given how <code class="inline">random.choice</code> is implemented, since there's not necessarily  an order for the elements of a set or dictionary, so you can't expect to subscript them. However they do provide an order when iterating over them and traversing the structure they exist in, so you could certainly use the same <code class="inline">O(n)</code> approach from above.</p>

<p>If there's some other less obvious way to do this in Java using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dependency_injection&oldid=260831402#A_code_illustration_using_Java">EnterpriseFactoryObserverFactoryFactoryCreator</a>, please leave a comment.</p>


<p><strong>Update: I overlooked something important, which was pointed out by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1452619">gojomo</a> on Hacker News. Set, which is returned from <code class="inline">keySet()</code> on HashMap, has an iterator. Thus:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public String randomKey() {
    int index = random.nextInt(map.size());
    for (String key: map.keySet()) {
        if (index-- == 0) {
            return key;
        }
    }
    return null;

<span class="preamble">When I originally thought about adding pattern matching to Python, in the <a href="http://sigusr2.net/2008/Sep/30/python-type-constructors-like-ocaml.html">OCaml sense</a>, I ended up using a decorator that more or less registed a bunch of callbacks with a dispatch table based on the types of it's arguments.</span>
</p>

<p>That worked out fine, but it didn't really have the feel of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern matching</a> like you get with real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">algebraic data types</a>. If you recall, I was playing with the following example with the decorator approach:
</p>

<pre><code class="ocaml">type astnode = 
| AndNode of astnode * astnode
| OrNode of astnode * astnode
| NotNode of astnode 
| IdNode of bool

let rec eval_node (n: astnode) = 
  match n with
  | AndNode (l, r) -> (eval_node l) && (eval_node r)
  | OrNode (l, r) -> (eval_node l) || (eval_node r)
  | NotNode l -> not (eval_node l)
  | IdNode v -> v

eval_node (AndNode (IdNode true, IdNode false)) (* returns false *)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea of that program was to create a small language to evaluate boolean expressions. In OCaml, it's quite succinct&mdash;too succinct, in all honesty. That's it. Of course it doesn't include a parser, or a lexer, but that's the crux of it.
</p>

<p>Since that original post, I've posted about two other <q>language hacks</q> that I've attempted to create&mdash;both of which use <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/">context managers</a> and the <code class="inline">with</code>-statement, <a href="http://sigusr2.net/2009/Oct/01/python-worlds.html">worlds</a> and <a href="http://sigusr2.net/2009/Mar/04/dispatching-with-with.html">dispatching urls (a la routes)</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, it occurred to me yesterday, that <code class="inline">with</code>'s <code class="inline">as</code> clause did destructuring of tuples, in the same way that the assignment statement does. That is to say:</p>

<pre><code class="python">a, b, c = 1, 2, 3</code></pre>

<p>Will correctly assign <code class="inline">a = 1</code>, <code class="inline">b = 2</code>, <code class="inline">c = 3</code>, in the same exact way that:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from contextlib import contextmanager
@contextmanager
def assign(*args):
    yield args

with assign(1, 2, 3) as (a, b, c,):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>will assign <code class="inline">a = 1</code>, <code class="inline">b = 2</code>, <code class="inline">c = 3</code>.</p>

<p>I'll admit, that doesn't look very powerful by itself, but when you consider the possibilities, you might come up with something like I did:</p>

<pre><code class="python">with structural_matching((1, 2, 3)) as match:
    with match('list() x y z') as (x, y, z):
        print x, y, z
    with match('tuple() x _ z') as (x, z):
        print "tuple case"
        print x, z
</code></pre>

<p>which looks incredibly close to pattern matching in OCaml. I was super excited&mdash;but it won't work.</p>

<p>See, <code class="inline">match</code> is a context manager that gets returned with the intention that if the <code class="inline">__enter__()</code> method raises a <code class="inline">NoMatch</code> exception, it skips the "body" and goes to the next match. The problem with that thinking however is simple&mdash;there's no way for <code class="inline">__enter__</code> to force skipping the body due to rejected <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0377/">PEP-377</a>!</p>

<p>In the example above (full source <a href="http://files.sigusr2.net/match1.py">here</a>), raising <code class="inline">NoMatch</code> in the first <code class="inline">match</code> block, results in control being passed back to the <code class="inline">__exit__()</code> of the outer context manager&mdash;<code class="inline">structural_matching</code>. And to think, I got my hopes up!</p>

<p>But nevertheless, I pressed on, and hacked <a href="http://files.sigusr2.net/match2.py">together</a>, a <code class="inline">match</code>, that can destructure the following examples correctly:</p>

<pre><code class="python">with match('[1:3]', [1, 2, 3, 4]) as (a,):
    print a
# [2, 3]

with match('[1:]', "hello world") as (a,):
    print a
# ('e', 'ello world')

with match('str() x y', 'hello world') as (h, e):
    print 'h = ', h, ',',
    print 'e = ', e
# h = h, e = e

with match('x y z', [1, 2, 3]) as (x, y, z,):
    print z, y, x
# 3 2 1

class obj(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

with match('obj() .x .y', obj('x-ity', 'y-ity')) as (x, y):
    print 'x = ', x, ',',
    print 'y = ', y
# x = x-ity, y = y-ity

with match('x y _', [1, 2, 3]) as (x, y):
    print x, y
# 1, 2
</code></pre>

<p>It's much less useful considering you can't put it in the <code class="inline">structural_match</code> block ,like you would in a <em>real</em> <code class="inline">match</code> statement, but it's all we've got.</p>

<p>Back then, I concluded with <q>This is as close to OCaml like  pattern matching that we're going to get, at least as far as I know how to get, but it's sort of cool, and definitely a hack.</q> Today, I'll conclude the same way.</p>

<entry><title>Remote Objects</title><link href="/2009/Nov/20/remote-objects.html"/><id>md5:c613f9f24fe2f9428acc9780d5c39573</id><updated>2009-11-20T00:00:00Z</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class="preamble">Back in May, I was tasked with migrating a few years worth of <a href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net/">Roundup</a> data to <a href="http://www.activecollab.com/">activeCollab</a>&mdash;a more featured project management and collaboration tool.</span></p>

<p>The move was justified, as Roundup no longer matched the way our organization wished to conduct business. It was a good move, but as with any migration there are bound to be some hiccups along the way.</p>

<p>Right away I hit one. The data models for these 2 very different pieces of software are insanely different (who knew?). Roundup makes <em>use of</em> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> database, but not in a traditional way. And, activeCollab combines almost all of its entities into one table. This of course makes querying with SQL incredibly difficult, and a SQL to SQL translation close to impossible.</p>

<p>Luckily, in moving to activeCollab, we inherited a somewhat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>, API that allows for the modification and creation of entities. As a result, it became apparent that the logical way to migrate this was to pull the data out using the Roundup's libraries and make the appropriate API calls with the translated data.</p>

<p>To make it easy on myself, I developed a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper">ORM</a>-like interface to the APIs. I had the idea that if I could make it work for activeCollab, it must be generalizable enough to work for other services and APIs as well, which I could do later.</p>

<p>And, I was right. It could be more generalized, and it could be useful. In fact, the idea was so useful that 3,000 miles away in the San Francisco office someone else was already secretly working on the same idea!</p>

<h3>Enter Remote Objects</h3>

<p>The result of the secretive effort, that I became aware of, is called <a href="http://github.com/sixapart/remoteobjects/">Remote Objects</a>, which identifies itself as <q>An object RESTational model.</q> <a href="http://sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> has graciously released it as part of the requirements to run <a href="http://www.typepad.com/go/motion">TypePad Motion</a>, which is also available, under a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_License">BSD License</a>, on <a href="http://github.com/sixapart/typepad-motion">github</a>.</p>

<p>But, just because its main intentions were for being used against the <a href="http://developer.typepad.com/api/rest.html">TypePad APIs</a>, doesn't mean that it <em>only</em> works with them.</p>

<p>In fact, the developers had the foresight to think that this would be useful in other cases too, just as I did, as can be seen in the <a href="http://github.com/sixapart/remoteobjects/tree/master/examples">examples</a> that come with the package.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I abandoned my implementation of this idea and will adopt Remote Objects in the future. Have a look. Hopefully it is useful in your toolbox too.</p>

<entry><title>Python Worlds</title><link href="/2009/Oct/01/python-worlds.html"/><id>md5:8ec25d2f452904fcb32829303656bf92</id><updated>2009-10-01T00:00:00Z</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class="preamble">Last year, I was introduced to a paper via <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3040">Lambda the Ultimate</a> about <q>worlds,</q> a language construct which allows one to control the scope of side effects while programming.</span></p>

<p>Worlds allow you to capture the current scope of a program in a first-class way. All updates to the current state (i.e. local variables, global variables) happen in a non-commiting way. In other words, you can back out of any changes at any time.</p>

<p>Consider the following example (taken from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/rn2008001_worlds.pdf">Warth paper</a>):</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">A = thisWorld; // thisWorld is always the current world
r = new Rectangle(4, 6);

B = A.sprout(); // sprout creates a new world with it's parent set to A
in B { r.h = 3; } // side effects within this `in' occur only in the world B.

C = A.sprout();
in C { r.h = 7 }; // in A's world r.h = 6 still.

C.commit(); // only now does r.h = 7 in world A.
</code></pre>

<p>If you follow along in the comments I've appended to the example, you'll start to see why this idea is interesting, even from this little example.</p>

<p>The astute Scheme programmer, however, will notice almost certainly that this construct could be created with <code class="inline">call/cc</code>, which is certainly true. The problem with this fact is that not all programming languages are Scheme (unfortunately), and of course not all languages support first-class <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation">continuations</a>.</p>

<p>The question I asked myself, however, is this: <q>Can I hack worlds into Python?</q> To which I came up with the short answer after some thinking, <q>sort of.</q>

<p>I guess I should explain what's going on more clearly in the example above. The first thing to note is that <code class="inline">A</code> represents the current scope; the current state of all variables in the program. <q>Sprouting</q> a new world from an existing world means that any changes that occur when using the sprouted world, do not affect the world who sprouted the current world, unless the new world <em>commits</em> the changes made to the original world.</p>

<p>Which is to say, changes that occur in an <code class="inline">in</code> block acting on world <code class="inline">X</code> do not propagate to the parent (the world <code class="inline">X</code> was sprouted from) of <code class="inline">X</code> unless <code class="inline">X.commit()</code> is called.</p>

<h3>Enter Context Managers</h3>

<p>A few months ago, I wrote a blog post about <em><a href="http://sigusr2.net/2009/Mar/04/dispatching-with-with.html">Dispatching With "with"</a></em>, in which I explained <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/">context managers</a> in Python, and how they can be exploited to create a less separated mapping from URLs to request handlers (something that definitely has its place in the small web-app world).</p>

<p>The basic idea of this was that in the <code class="inline">__exit__</code> method of the web-application object, the current frame was inspected and references to functions that represent HTTP methods would be collected, stored and tied to the last regular expression passed to the <code class="inline">expose</code> method in the application object. This simple solution allowed us to express a web application succinctly like so:

<pre><code class="python">app = web.application()
with app.expose('/'):
   def get(): 
       return "Hello World"
app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>For worlds, I also exploit context managers, though mostly for the <code class="inline">in</code>-like syntax, and for managing the current <code class="inline">thisWorld</code> variable.</p>

<p>The quick<a href="#f1">[1]</a> solution that I came up with for <a href="http://github.com/apgwoz/python-worlds">implementing worlds</a> can be used like so:</p>

<pre><code class="python">with Universe(): # establishes new world, assigns to local variable `thisWorld'
   thisWorld.r = True # must assign <em>directly</em> in the world. LIMITATION
   new = thisWorld.sprout() 

   with new:
       new.r = False

   with new.sprout():
       thisWorld.r = 15
       thisWorld.commit() # now new.r is 15, but the original r is still True

   print thisWorld.r # => True
   new.commit()
   print thisWorld.r # => 15
   thisWorld.commit() # have to commit to the actual scope LIMITATION
   # r is now part of the local variables where this universe exists
   print r # => 15 
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at this example, it's already apparent that the Warth implementation of worlds is superior, just in the amount of code needed to take advantage of it. You might also see that I didn't even attempt to port the rectangle example  from above. That is because there isn't anything smart going on under the hood when it comes to container objects (such as lists, tuples, objects, dicts), and I'm not yet sure how to get there.</p>

<p>With simple immutable objects such as booleans, integers and strings, using copy-on-write semantics works wonderfully. Then, on <code class="inline">commit</code> of the world, the code just copies all of the changes into its parent. I haven't tackled the case of mutable container objects just yet, as there are complications in the API<a href="#f2">[2]</a>, as well as the implementation.</p>

<p>The interaction with this is sort of annoying though. In order to take advantage of worlds in Python, you have to touch virtually every line of code in the function you are trying to <q>worldize</q>, because you must assign explicitly to a world. The world's context manager sets up <code class="inline">thisWorld</code> for you, but you still have to do <code class="inline">thisWorld.<em>variable</em></code> to get any sort of benefit.</p>

<p>My inclination is to get into some bytecode hacking to modify all assignments within the <code class="inline">with</code> block to be assignments to <code class="inline">thisWorld</code> automatically, but bytecode hacks are neither pleasant to maintain, nor are they portable across implementations.</p>

<p>It's also possible in the Warth version to <q>worldize</q> functions and any other first class object. Maybe the solution is simple and I just haven't seen it yet. Whatever hacks, that I come up with though, will be just that, hacks, as there is no <em>easy</em> way to add worlds to Python in the same way that Warth added them to JavaScript<a href="#f3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>We are in an age of programming where mainstream programming languages are unable to adapt to our needs as programmers. We are unable to bend them at our will like we can with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a>, <a href="http://common-lisp.net/">Lisp</a> and even <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. Attempts to bring about change on this front have not been met with enthusiasm from most groups. Whether it's a lack of marketing, evangelism or just that the general population doesn't view <q>unbendability</q> as a problem, I'm not sure. But, I for one like the idea of being able to <em>easily</em> add worlds, and other ideas, as <em>true</em> language features to languages that by practicality, I'm forced into using. That would make me a much happier, and effective programmer.</p>

<ol class="footnotes">
    <li id="f1">By quick, I do mean quick. This was 2 hours of work and sketching. Surely there is lots of work to be done to make it a true solution.</li>
    <li id="f2">The same strategy could be used as for simple values like booleans, if the API used a method, say <code class="inline">assign</code> instead of the more natural assignment operator. Consider, <code class="inline">thisWorld.assign('obj.height.inches', 30)</code> vs. <code class="inline">thisWorld.obj.height.inches = 30</code>.</li>
    <li id="f3">The Worlds prototype was written in <a href="http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/">OMeta</a>, which is a solution to the "unbendable" languages problem. Note: I didn't attempt to write worlds in PyMeta, but, it may be possible to do.</li>

<p>It is the ever so common case that you always hear, <q>It works fine here, it must be your fault.</q> And, boy did I come up with some interesting theories as to why it was not the fault of my code.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm POSTing some data to a resource that is protected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</a>, and then reading the response for further processing. It is a basic task, and one that I've done many times in the past.</p>

<code class="python">headers = {'User-Agent': useragent}

passmgr.add_password(None, url, username, passwd)

</pre>

<p>In this case, the following behavior is seen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Client (urllib2) POSTs data leaving out the <code class="inline">Authorization</code> header</li>
  <li>Server responds with a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.2">401</a>. Client (urllib2) never sees the 401 error, and instead gets a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGPIPE">SIGPIPE</a></li>
  <li>Client attempts to reconnect, going right back to step 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally, the only way I discovered this was to fire up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump">tcpdump</a> and look at what was being sent. It quickly became obvious that there was never an <code class="inline">Authorization</code> header being sent, and therefore the 401 was completely justified. The broken pipe seems to have come from the server responding before reading all of the posted data to thwart off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of service</a> attacks.</p>

<p>My only explanation for why this works perfectly fine on my laptop and not in either of the data centers I tried running it from is latency, though I'm shocked, and not yet convinced, by that result.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I solved the problem by sending the <code class="inline">Authorization</code> header on first request, rather than waiting for the confirmation that, yes indeed, the resource needs the Authorization header sent, as <code class="inline">urllib2</code> likes to do.</p>

<code class="python">headers = {'User-Agent': useragent, 
         'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64.b64encode(username + ':' + passwd)}
req = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers)
connection = urllib2.urlopen(req)
</code>

<p>... and now it works fine.</p>

<p>This whole experience will make me think twice before laying the blame anywhere until I have uncovered the real truth, something I think all programmers should learn to do, if they don't know already.</p>

<entry><title>The Case of the Unusable Reusable</title><link href="/2009/Jul/22/case-of-the-unusable-reusable.html"/><id>md5:1790e770e90b7ed37ba8eeeda62034a7</id><updated>2009-07-22T00:00:00Z</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class="preamble">The <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework has a huge following that releases lots of simple reusable apps that can be plugged into your website. However, sometimes they are too simple, and not "plugin-able" quite enough.</span></p>

<p>Take for instance <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-favorites/" title="django-favorites on Google Code">django-favorites</a>. By itself it's a great package that does exactly what you want&mdash;it allows a user to mark things as being a favorite. Notice that I said "things." "Things" here means any model, because it uses the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#id1" title="Generic Relations">generic relationships</a> framework that Django provides.</p>

<p>This is a huge win on its own because it means that I don't have to define a new favorites model for blog posts, one for photos and another for music I'm listening too. But, there's a downside to this as well.</p>

<p>How do I check to see if an item is a favorite? Well, for each blog post I select back from the database, I have to make another query to see whether or not it was a favorite or not. Alternatively, of course, I could be smarter and do a bulk query using an <code class="inline">IN</code> clause, making the query count only 2. But, if I wasn't using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" title="Object Relational Mapper">ORM</a>, my SQL would use an <code class="inline">OUTER JOIN</code>, or a sub-query to select back whether or not it was marked a favorite for the current user.</p>

<p>Django can do this using the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#queryset-methods-that-return-new-querysets"><code class="inline">extra</code></a> method for <code class="inline">QuerySet</code>s.</p>

<p>Ok, so we can use <code class="inline">extra</code> every time we want to 
select back whether or not an item is a favorite, no big deal.</p>

<code class="python">content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Photo)
SQL = """SELECT 1 FROM favorites_favorite f
WHERE f.content_type_id = %(content_type)d and
      f.object_id = photos_photo.id and
      f.user_id = %(user_id)d
"""
attrs = {'content_type': content_type.id, 'user_id': user.id}
entries = Photo.objects.extra(select={'is_favorite': SQL % attrs})
</code>

<p>Except that you have to do this every time. So, you then create a custom manager for <code class="inline">Photo</code> that includes a <code class="inline">check_is_favorite</code> method, which adds the <code class="inline">is_favorite</code> pseudo-column and everything is good.</p>

<p>That is until you have to do it for <code class="inline">Entry</code>, and <code class="inline">Song</code>, and <code class="inline">User</code>.</p>

<p>The solution however is simple. Reusable apps should include a "ManagerMixin", if it makes sense to make reusing the app as painless as possible. The django-favorites application that I've been using in my example would be complete in my eyes if it had something like this defined in it:</p>

<code class="python">class FavoritesManagerMixin(object):
    """ A Mixin to add a `favorite__favorite` column via extra 
    """
    def with_favorite_for(self, user, all=True):
        """ Adds a column favorite__favorite to the returned object, which
        indicates whether or not this item is a favorite for a user
        """
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(self.model)
        pk_field = "%s.%s" % (qn(self.model._meta.db_table),
                              qn(self.model._meta.pk.column))

        favorite_sql = """(SELECT 1 FROM %(favorites_db_table)s 
WHERE %(favorites_db_table)s.object_id = %(pk_field)s and
      %(favorites_db_table)s.content_type_id = %(content_type)d and
      %(favorites_db_table)s.user_id = %(user_id)d)
""" % {'pk_field': pk_field, \
           'db_table': qn(self.model._meta.db_table), \
           'favorites_db_table': qn(Favorite._meta.db_table), \
           'user_id': user.pk, \
           'content_type': content_type.id, \
           }

        extras = {
            'select': {'favorite__favorite': favorite_sql},
            }

        if not all:
            extras['where'] = ['favorite__favorite == 1']

        return self.extra(**extras)
</code>

<p>I have yet to run a bench mark against this to determine whether or not the sub-query here is less efficient than doing an <code class="inline">OUTER JOIN</code>. My gut says it would be, but for a first go at it, I'll keep it like this.</p>

<p>Anyway, then to make use of this you create a custom manager that uses <code class="inline">FavoritesManagerMixin</code> as one of its base classes:</p>

<code class="python">class SongManager(models.Manager, <strong>FavoritesMixinManager</strong>):
    pass

class Song(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=False, blank=False)
    artist = models.ForeignKey('Artist')
    album = models.ForeignKey('Album')

    <strong>objects = SongManager()</strong>
</code>

<p>And then to make use of it, we do:</p>
<code class="python">all_songs_with_favorites_marked = Song.objects.with_favorite_for(user)
only_favorite_songs = Song.objects.with_favorite_for(user, all=False)
</code>

<p>The intention of this post isn't to point out a flaw in django-favorites, an otherwise great reusable application, BTW, but instead is meant to give a way that this idea of reusable can actually be usable.</p>

<p>I put my django-favorites on <a href="http://github.com/apgwoz/django-favorites/">github</a>. Feel free to flame me for going against what this post stands for and creating yet another "favorites" reusable app, without submitting a patch to the original, I wanted some practice in Django development.

<entry><title>Dispatching With "with"</title><link href="/2009/Mar/04/dispatching-with-with.html"/><id>md5:c47b741e6d7072c9b14a6d5f74c671f1</id><updated>2009-03-04T08:15:00Z</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
<span class="preamble">Since <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.5, we've had access to a new contstruct called the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/"><code class="inline">with</code></a>-statement. Using them is as simple as implementing the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typecontextmanager.html">context manager protocol</a> for classes.
</span>
</p>

<p>The <code class="inline">with</code>-statement makes it possible to factor our <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> statements that are commonly used to clean up resources created temporarily. Suppose for example, you have a multi-threaded application that makes use of mutexes to guard shared information. As a general rule, once you lock and perform the update on the shared variable, you need to unlock. Failure to unlock can lead to horrible problems, such as starvation or some other inconsistent state. 
</p>

<p>And, what happens if an exception occurs before you unlock? Quite frankly, you're out of luck unless you use <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> to clean up regardless of what happens. It might look something like this:</p>

<code class="python">lock.lock()
try:
    # perform some action
finally:
    lock.unlock()
</code>

<p>This ensures that <code class="inline">lock</code> is unlocked after the action is performed.</p>

<p>Now, using the <code class="inline">with</code>-statement we get something more like:</p>
<code class="python">with lock:
    # perform some action
</code>

<p>The beauty is that we don't have to worry about remembering to call <code class="inline">unlock</code>, or wrap it up in the <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> block. It does it for us.</p>

<p>But, we're not worried about locks here. We're interested in using <code class="inline">with</code> for another purpose, dispatching based on a requested url.</p>

<h3>URL Dispatching</h3>

<p>In many web frameworks these days for Python, such as <a href="http://webpy.org">web.py</a>, resources are dispatched to based on a regular expression that gets matched against the REQUEST_URI environment variable. This is normally pretty powerful, but in the case of web.py, the way this is specified is often a bit awkward. Take for instance:
</p>

<code class="python">import web

urls = (
    '/([a-zA-Z]*)', 'Hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class Hello:
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name:
            name = 'world'
        return "Hello,", name

    def POST(self, name): # name can still be in the url
        i = web.input(name='world')
        return "You posted your name! Hello,", i.name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code>

<p>which is a whole web application written in web.py. The awkwardness comes from the fact that the regular expression used for dispatch, is in no way connected to the resource itself. It'd be nice to use decorators for this so you could get something like:</p>

<code class="python">@web.expose('/([a-zA-Z]*)')
class Hello:
    ...
</code>

<p>but Python didn't get class decorators til Python 3.0, which many people aren't using yet, the author included. And what's the logic behind <code class="inline">def GET(<strong>self</strong>, ...)</code>? It's required in Python, but is just extraneous when defining a resource for web.py.</p>

<p>What if we implemented the context manager protocol in the object returned by <code class="inline">web.application()</code> above that looked like this (or something similiar):
</p>

<code class="python">import inspect
    --snip--
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        frame = inspect.currentframe()
        get = frame.f_back.f_locals.get('get', None)
        post = frame.f_back.f_locals.get('post', None)
        resource = {}
        if get:
            resource['get'] = get
        if post:
            resource['post'] = post

        if not (post or get):
            raise ValueError("with must have a get or post function")
        self._resources.append((re.compile(self._last_url), resource))

        if get:
            del frame.f_back.f_locals['get']
        if post:
            del frame.f_back.f_locals['post']

    def expose(self, url):
        self._last_url = url
        return self

    ...
</code>

<p>Then, the simple hello application instead looks like:</p>

<code class="python">import web

app = web.application()

with app.expose('/([a-zA-Z]*)'):
    def get(name):
        if not name:
            name = 'world'
        return "Hello,", name

    def post(name):
        i = web.input(name='world')
        return "You posted your name! Hello,", i.name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code>

<p>It's declarative, simple, and eliminates a lot of noise, but we no longer get the packaging, or the ability to easily seperate our resources into multiple files. But, for one file web apps, maybe it's useful.</p>

How do you test if two strings are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram">anagrams</a> of each other?</span></p>

<p>There are many ways, but the naive solution is to simply sort both strings, character-wise, and then compare the results. In <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, you might do that like so (We'll leave out the fact that anagrams are actually real words and phrases. We also work in a case-sensitive manor [e.g. "JimMorrison" and "MrMojoRisin" isn't truthy, though a simple <code class="inline">s.lower()</code> goes a long way.]):</p>

<code class="python">def isAnagram(str1, str2):
    if len(str1) != len(str2): return False
    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)
</code>

<p>Here, I'm using <code class="inline">sorted</code>, a Python <code class="inline">__builtin__</code>, that takes an iterable and produces a sorted list of that iterable. I'm then taking advantage of the fact that Python lists can be compared element-wise with the <code class="inline">==</code> operator. Doing this produces a function that will work on any string, and it's simple to see why. Sort the string "parental" and you get "aaelnprt." Sort the string "paternal" and you still get "aaelnprt." Obviously "aaelnprt" and "aaelnprt" are equivalent. This of course returns <code class="inline">False</code> for the strings "snowman" and "iceman" since they don't compare sorted equally (or non-sorted for that matter).</p>

<p>However, this solution isn't the most efficient use of resources. For one, most sorting algorithms are only <em>O(n log n)</em>, which means in the best case <code class="inline">isAnagram</code> is too. It also needs to allocate two lists to store the results returned by <code class="inline">sorted</code>.</p>

<p>There is of course a way to do better. You just have to think about the problem for a little longer than a minute:</p>

<code class="python">def isAnagramN(str1, str2):
    if len(str1) != len(str2): return False
    counts = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])

    for c1, c2 in izip(str1, str2):
        counts[c1][0] += 1
        counts[c2][1] += 1

    for k, v in counts.iteritems():
        if v[0] != v[1]:
            return False
    return True
</code>

<p>This code does not allocate proportionally to the size of the strings, but instead on the diversity of the strings. In other words, <code class="inline">isAnagramN("aaaaaaa", "bbbbbbb")</code> allocates 1 defaultdict, and 2 lists of size 2. Why? Because, the algorithm simply counts up how many times each letter occurs in each string. Of course Python also has to allocate the generators to use for <code class="inline">izip</code> and <code class="inline">counts.iteritems()</code>, but that isn't significant. The big win here of course is that given strings of <em>any</em> length, the algorithm uses only as much space as the diversity of the contents contained in the strings!</p>

<p>As if that wasn't a win enough, this algorithm runs in <em>O(n)</em> on the length of the strings!</p>

<p>But, does it actually make a difference? The answer of course is yes. For strings of significant length, <code class="inline">isAnagramN</code> runs almost 2x as fast as <code class="inline">isAnagram</code>.</p>

<p>The proof is in the bacon, so let's take a look at some numbers. Using Python's <code class="inline">timeit</code> module, I tested strings of length 1 through 100,001, incrementing by 10,000 (I've tested other lengths as well, and reach a similar conclusion). At each length, the test was repeated 50 times. The results are below:</p>

<span class="preamble">Earlier this summer, I started taking a look at the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/" title="Objective-Caml">OCaml</a> programming language in anticipation of the compilers class I'm taking this fall.</span>
</p>

<p>OCaml is a strongly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_typing">statically typed</a>, functional language with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type inference</a>. It's pretty neat, and supports imperative programming as well as object-oriented constructs for when you need them. As a language, I've found few things wrong with it, except for the edit-compile-run cycle (I prefer the edit-run cycle you get in a language like Scheme, or even Python), but OCaml does actually have a toplevel (the toplevel isn't crippled either, but it doesn't seem realistic to not compile for testing, at least I haven't yet found it to be). 
</p>

<p>Anyway, among all the amazing features of OCaml, the two that stand out as being the most useful are pattern matching (on types) and the simplicity of defining new types and creating constructors:</p>

<pre><code class="ocaml">type astnode = 
| AndNode of astnode * astnode
| OrNode of astnode * astnode
| NotNode of astnode 
| IdNode of bool

let rec eval_node (n: astnode) = 
  match n with
  | AndNode (l, r) -> (eval_node l) && (eval_node r)
  | OrNode (l, r) -> (eval_node l) || (eval_node r)
  | NotNode l -> not (eval_node l)
  | IdNode v -> v

eval_node (AndNode (IdNode true, IdNode false)) (* returns false *)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the type annotation, <code class="inline">(n: astnode)</code>, is optional due to the type inference engine, but the above example shows a simple example type that might be used when defining a language to do boolean arithmetic. It's quick to see that the combination of type constructors (like the <code class="inline">IdNode</code> above) and pattern matching simplify this incredibly.
</p>

<p>But, we don't get this sort of coolness in Python. No, in Python, we can make classes, but we do not get type checking of any kind, unless of course we do it at runtime manually. That's because Python is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_typing">dynamically typed</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we <em>really</em> want to, we can use the built in functions <code class="inline">isinstance</code> and <code class="inline">type</code> to raise errors when incompatible types are passed along to functions. This is slow, but it works. And, in some cases, like the one I'm about to show, maybe it doesn't matter, if you get certain benefits.</p>

<p>Consider a language, like before, that does boolean arithmetic. It'll support boolean <abbr title="Both true">AND</a> (&amp;), <abbr title="One or the other true">OR</abbr> (|), <abbr title="One or the other true, but not both">XOR</abbr> (^) and NOT (!). A valid expression in this language is of the form <code class="inline">t & !(f | t)</code> which evaluates to <code class="inline">false</code>.</p>

<p>I've created two different parsers for this language. In <a href="http://hg.apgwoz.com/boolinterp/file/0c592ee06c7f/bptuples.py" rel="nofollow">bptuples</a>, I create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</a> using Python tuples of the form <code class="inline">('AndNode', t, f)</code>. In <a href="http://hg.apgwoz.com/boolinterp/file/0c592ee06c7f/bpnodes.py" rel="nofollow">bpnodes</a>, however, I take a more elegant approach when building the <abbr title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</abbr>&mdash;I create "OCaml like" type constructors.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
ASTNode = deftype('ASTNode', ())
AndNode = deftype('AndNode', (ASTNode, ASTNode,), ASTNode)
OrNode = deftype('OrNode', (ASTNode, ASTNode,), ASTNode)
XorNode = deftype('XorNode', (ASTNode, ASTNode,), ASTNode)
NotNode = deftype('NotNode', (ASTNode,), ASTNode)
IdNode = deftype('IdNode', (bool,), ASTNode)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines all the Python classes needed at runtime. <code class="inline">deftype</code> takes up to 3 arguments. The first argument is the name of the class, the second is a tuple of classes which it can accept as arguments, and the optional third argument is a parent class to inherit from. The optional third argument is only necessary if you need multiple constructors for the same type, as in the case of our OCaml example above, and this example here.</p>

<p>The code for <code class="inline">deftype</code> is actually pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def deftype(name, types, extends=None):
    class _dtype(object):
        def __init__(self, *args):
            for i, a in enumerate(zip(args, self.types)):
                if isinstance(a[0], a[1]):
                    self.__setattr__('op%d' % i, a[0])
                else:
                    raise TypeError("%s expected argument of type " % \
                                        (self.__class__.__name__,
                                         str(a[1])))
    if extends:
        parents = (_dtype, extends,)
    else:
        parents = (_dtype,)
    return type(name, parents, {'types': types})
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, what it does is use the Python built-in <code class="inline">type</code> to construct a class at runtime with an attribute called <code class="inline">types</code> which holds the class names of the expected arguments to the constructor of the type. On construction, the arguments are enumerated and attributes are created of the form <code class="inline">op0</code>...<code class="inline">opN</code>.</p>

<p>It's a mouthful, for sure, but all that means is that when we construct a new <code class="inline">AndNode</code>, we are sure that the arguments the instance was created with are indeed <code class="inline">ASTNode</code>s, and those nodes are accessible at <code class="inline">op0</code> and <code class="inline">op1</code>.</p>

<p>At a cursory glance, you might be thinking, "but what does this actually do for us?" Well, honestly, not much, but you do get to abstract out some more runtime type checking and do dynamic dispatch with the help of some Python decorators. Observe:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
@multimethod(AndNode)
def interpret(ast):
    return interpret(ast.op0) and interpret(ast.op1)

@multimethod(XorNode)
def interpret(ast):
    left = interpret(ast.op0)
    right = interpret(ast.op1)
    return (left or right) and not (left and right)

@multimethod(OrNode)
def interpret(ast):
    return interpret(ast.op0) or interpret(ast.op1)

@multimethod(NotNode)
def interpret(ast):
    return not interpret(ast.op0)

@multimethod(IdNode)
def interpret(ast):
    return ast.op0
</code></pre>

<p>That's the entire interpreter to walk the AST and evaluate boolean expressions, and is called via <code class="inline">interpret(parseBool(tokenizer('t & ! (t | f)')))</code>.</p>

<p>In the tuple version, it's actually shorter when you use <code class="inline">if</code> statements, but this approach is much more readable in my opinion. The <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=101605">multimethod decorator</a> runs the correct <code class="inline">interpret</code> based on the types of arguments.</p>

<p> This is as close to OCaml like  pattern matching that we're going to get, at least as far as I know how to get, but it's sort of cool, and definitely a hack.</p>
