<span class="preamble">Since <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.5, we've had access to a new contstruct called the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/"><code class="inline">with</code></a>-statement. Using them is as simple as implementing the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typecontextmanager.html">context manager protocol</a> for classes.
</span>
</p>

<p>The <code class="inline">with</code>-statement makes it possible to factor our <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> statements that are commonly used to clean up resources created temporarily. Suppose for example, you have a multi-threaded application that makes use of mutexes to guard shared information. As a general rule, once you lock and perform the update on the shared variable, you need to unlock. Failure to unlock can lead to horrible problems, such as starvation or some other inconsistent state. 
</p>

<p>And, what happens if an exception occurs before you unlock? Quite frankly, you're out of luck unless you use <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> to clean up regardless of what happens. It might look something like this:</p>

<code class="python">lock.lock()
try:
    # perform some action
finally:
    lock.unlock()
</code>

<p>This ensures that <code class="inline">lock</code> is unlocked after the action is performed.</p>

<p>Now, using the <code class="inline">with</code>-statement we get something more like:</p>
<code class="python">with lock:
    # perform some action
</code>

<p>The beauty is that we don't have to worry about remembering to call <code class="inline">unlock</code>, or wrap it up in the <code class="inline">try</code>/<code class="inline">finally</code> block. It does it for us.</p>

<p>But, we're not worried about locks here. We're interested in using <code class="inline">with</code> for another purpose, dispatching based on a requested url.</p>

<h3>URL Dispatching</h3>

<p>In many web frameworks these days for Python, such as <a href="http://webpy.org">web.py</a>, resources are dispatched to based on a regular expression that gets matched against the REQUEST_URI environment variable. This is normally pretty powerful, but in the case of web.py, the way this is specified is often a bit awkward. Take for instance:
</p>

<code class="python">import web

urls = (
    '/([a-zA-Z]*)', 'Hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class Hello:
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name:
            name = 'world'
        return "Hello,", name

    def POST(self, name): # name can still be in the url
        i = web.input(name='world')
        return "You posted your name! Hello,", i.name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code>

<p>which is a whole web application written in web.py. The awkwardness comes from the fact that the regular expression used for dispatch, is in no way connected to the resource itself. It'd be nice to use decorators for this so you could get something like:</p>

<code class="python">@web.expose('/([a-zA-Z]*)')
class Hello:
    ...
</code>

<p>but Python didn't get class decorators til Python 3.0, which many people aren't using yet, the author included. And what's the logic behind <code class="inline">def GET(<strong>self</strong>, ...)</code>? It's required in Python, but is just extraneous when defining a resource for web.py.</p>

<p>What if we implemented the context manager protocol in the object returned by <code class="inline">web.application()</code> above that looked like this (or something similiar):
</p>

<code class="python">import inspect
    --snip--
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        frame = inspect.currentframe()
        get = frame.f_back.f_locals.get('get', None)
        post = frame.f_back.f_locals.get('post', None)
        resource = {}
        if get:
            resource['get'] = get
        if post:
            resource['post'] = post

        if not (post or get):
            raise ValueError("with must have a get or post function")
        self._resources.append((re.compile(self._last_url), resource))

        if get:
            del frame.f_back.f_locals['get']
        if post:
            del frame.f_back.f_locals['post']

    def expose(self, url):
        self._last_url = url
        return self

    ...
</code>

<p>Then, the simple hello application instead looks like:</p>

<code class="python">import web

app = web.application()

with app.expose('/([a-zA-Z]*)'):
    def get(name):
        if not name:
            name = 'world'
        return "Hello,", name

    def post(name):
        i = web.input(name='world')
        return "You posted your name! Hello,", i.name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code>

<p>It's declarative, simple, and eliminates a lot of noise, but we no longer get the packaging, or the ability to easily seperate our resources into multiple files. But, for one file web apps, maybe it's useful.</p>
